# hackathon chessout

Specific notes for hackathon

## how it started

Chessout started as a side personal project during covid. I got laid off (economic unemployment) but still believed in the company I was working in so I had a lot of time. I invested my free time and it shaping up to be a good project. I'm a parent and my children play chess so I created this project to tackle the most painful frustrations that a parent who loves chess has
- no notifications when your kids finish a game
- extremely hard to organize a casual tournaments

I shared this project once I had something to show with some tournament organizers and they loved it. The parents loved it too. 

Now, it is used in some major tournaments in Belgium. After the hackathon, I'll show it to more club owners and chess lovers across Europe. I hope they will love it too. 

## what is chessout
Chessout is a simple service focused on user experience for all people involved and somehow involved in a chess tournament. 
People involved in a chess tournament are
- parents and loved ones who are rooting for some players. (These are chessout most important users. You now get push notifications and real-time updates for anything that happens during a tournament. )
- chess players
- tournament organizers
- tournament arbiters
- catering services
- casual coffee or beer drinkers

## multiversX business case
The idea is simple. Organizing a tournament even now is extremely difficult and there are a lot of logistics that take a lot of man hours and huge responsibility. Chessout can simplify most organisational and financial logistics. 

Smart contracts will handle
- the financial transaction to pay and automatically sign up for the tournament
- distributing the tournament prizes
- defining what the local bare contains for each tournament event
- pay for coffey beer and much more (It started in Belgium anyway)

The smart-contract will get a small percentage fee from all mentioned transactions. 

## future multiversX ideas

To encourage people to play more chess outside we will implement a staking mechanism. If a certain club processes a specific amount of funds they will get the option of increased yields for a limited time period. This will encourage people to
- get more social in the real world
- build strong communities with a positive attitude
- play more chess
- be happier

# Chessout: A Blockchain-Powered Chess Tournament Platform

## How It Started
Chessout began as a personal project during the COVID-19 pandemic. After being laid off, I invested my time in creating a solution to address the frustrations faced by chess-loving parents and tournament organizers. The key pain points were:
- Lack of notifications when kids finish a chess game.
- Difficulty in organizing casual tournaments.

I shared this project with tournament organizers, and the response was overwhelming. Parents and tournament organizers loved it. Today, it's used in major tournaments in Belgium, and I plan to expand its reach across Europe after the hackathon.

## What Is Chessout
Chessout is a blockchain-powered platform designed for everyone involved in chess tournaments:
- Parents and supporters receive real-time updates and push notifications.
- Chess players benefit from streamlined tournament organization.
- Tournament organizers find it easier to manage logistics.
- Tournament arbiters gain tools for efficient decision-making.
- Catering services can offer event-specific menus.
- Casual coffee or beer drinkers can enjoy their beverages hassle-free.

## MultiversX Business Case
Chessout simplifies tournament logistics through blockchain technology. Key features include:
- Utilization of smart contracts to handle financial transactions, such as tournament entry fees and prize distribution.
- Defining event-specific menus for catering services through blockchain.
- Facilitating payments for refreshments, like coffee and beer.
- Earning revenue through small percentage fees on blockchain transactions.

## Future MultiversX Ideas
To encourage chess enthusiasts to play more and build stronger communities, we plan to implement a staking mechanism:
- Clubs processing a specific fund threshold will enjoy increased yields for a limited time.
- This mechanism fosters real-world social interaction and positive community building.
- Players are incentivized to play more chess, leading to a happier and more engaged community.

Chessout leverages blockchain technology to enhance transparency, security, and efficiency in chess tournaments, revolutionizing the way we organize and enjoy chess events.

## Conclusion
Chessout is more than a chess tournament platform; it's a blockchain-driven solution that simplifies logistics, increases engagement, and fosters stronger chess communities. We invite developers at the hackathon to explore its blockchain features and be a part of this exciting journey.

## Mono repo structure
- chessout-app: this is the web app that we build from zero in only 2 weeks for the hackaton
- chessout-contract: the smart contract
- chessout-android: this is the android kotlin based app. We would love fi multiversX would provide support for native aplciations to integrate with xPortal. 
- chessout-shared: is the comon libraries used ty kotlin and backend. We plan to add also the backend here once we clean up some code.
