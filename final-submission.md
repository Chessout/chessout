Chessout: A Blockchain-Powered Chess Tournament Platform
Chessout is a blockchain-driven solution designed for chess enthusiasts. It offers real-time updates for parents, streamlines tournament organization for players, and simplifies logistics for tournament organizers. Key features include smart contracts for financial transactions and a revenue model. Chessout enhances transparency, security, and efficiency in chess tournaments, fostering stronger communities.



B: What are the goals for your project after the hackathon? Please include a clear roadmap.

After the hackathon, Chessout has an exciting and ambitious roadmap in place to further enhance the platform and bring more value to the chess community. Here are the key goals and milestones:

Integrate MultiversX into Mobile Apps: Our immediate focus is to integrate MultiversX technology into the mobile versions of Chessout, starting with Android. This will provide a seamless and secure experience for mobile users.

Develop an iOS Version: We plan to expand our reach by creating an iOS version of Chessout, making it accessible to a broader audience of Apple device users.

Chessout Coin Creation: To optimize the platform's transactional efficiency, we will create the Chessout Coin. This native token will offer lower transaction fees compared to other cryptocurrencies like EGLD or stablecoins. It will simplify transactions within the Chessout ecosystem.

Staking Platform Implementation: Chessout aims to encourage chess enthusiasts to play more and become part of chess clubs. We will develop a staking mechanism that rewards clubs achieving specific fund thresholds with increased yields. This incentive structure will promote real-world chess community engagement.

Promote Adoption Among Chess Clubs: We will work diligently to convince as many chess clubs as possible to adopt Chessout when running chess tournaments. This includes providing support, resources, and incentives to make Chessout the go-to platform for chess events.

Expand Geographically: Chessout will expand its reach beyond its current usage in Belgium. The goal is to make Chessout a Europe-wide solution for chess tournaments, catering to a more extensive and diverse chess-playing community.

Enhanced User Experience: Continual improvement of the Chessout user experience, including accessibility features and cross-device responsiveness, will be a priority. We want to make sure Chessout remains intuitive and easy to use.

Regulatory Compliance and Security: Ensure Chessout adheres to legal, ethical, and regulatory standards while maintaining a high level of security to protect user data and privacy.

Community Engagement and Education: Chessout will actively engage with the chess community, providing educational resources and support to help players, organizers, and clubs make the most of the platform.

Chessout is committed to revolutionizing the chess tournament experience, and this roadmap outlines our dedication to achieving that goal.

# First draft presentation

1. What is chessout
Chessout is the real live social chess platform of your dreams

2. Design to simplify all logistics of organizing a running a chess tournament outside

3. I'm a parrent and chessout addresses the main painpoints of players, parents, oganizers and extended grups of supporters for all participants of the tournaments. 

4. This was a side project and it has already overwelming intrest from the public. It is now used by major chess clubs in Belgium and also by official Belgium Chess Federation. 

5. Now with the integration of multiversX chessout simplifies also the finantial aspects of organizing a tournament. 
- Organizers can specify entry fees
- Participants can pay using multivers x tranzactions and get automaticaly registered in tourhaments. 
- Organazers can specify who are the wineers and all verious prizes and can distribute all the rewords and prizes with only one tranzaction. 

6. Demo time
- I already created a chessout tournament for this presentation and this is how chessout looks when you only use web2. 
- This is the tournament and these are the participants to the tournamet. 
- On multiversX as a manager you can say thi is a multiversX tournament. 
- From this point anyone who wants to join they can just pay directly and sign players in the tournament. 
- This way organizers they can keep doing what they do best and offer more attention to participangs and supporters present at the venue. 
- At the end with only one transaction they can distribute prizes and rewords. 
- This is it. Very simple and blocchain aspects are ingegratede elegantly in chessout. Web3 aspects of chessout are almost invisible and do not get in the way, they acutaly ecurage people to get get out and socialize and play more chess outside. 

7. Thank you for taking the time for viewing this untill the end. I hope you understend better now what Chessout is and how elegant is it's integration with multiversX
