## Welcome to chessout

I'm very exited about chessout. Chessout has already bean used in real-life tournaments and it has
proven that is already a huge jump in the experience quality that you get when participating,
following or organizing chess tournaments.

## For who is fore

Chessout improves the experience for everyone that loves playing chess in real live and it makes no
discrimination if is just a friendly game, a tournament between friends or an official tournament.

- tournament organizers
- tournament participants
- anyone that is interested in live updates on events related to a specific tournament or game.

Because it enhancing the social experience of any type of game played on a real board in real life, chessout also aims to dramatically boost the number of day to day chess games between friends or at official tournament.
Chess is an amazing game. Lets play more chess.


## Why current alternative tools are so bad

Currently the tools used in order to organize chess tournaments are more then 20 years long and litiraly no efort has bean implemented in this space in order to impove the experience related to organizing participating or followig chess tournaments.
